            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                Jambalaya is a one-pot dish that's made with rice, meat or seafood, and vegetables. With French and
                Spanish influences, jambalaya is quite similar to paella. The name "jambalaya" likely comes from the
                Provençal word "jambalaia," which means mishmash.
